  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: More than 300 million people carry a diagnosis of
               asthma, with data to suggest that they are at a higher risk for
               infection or adverse outcomes from severe acute respiratory
               syndrome coronavirus 2. Asthma is remarkably heterogeneous, and
               it is currently unclear how patient-intrinsic factors may relate
               to coronavirus disease 2019. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify
               and characterize subsets of patients with asthma at increased
               risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
               infection. METHODS: Participants from 2 large asthma cohorts
               were stratified using clinically relevant parameters to identify
               factors related to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2)
               expression within bronchial epithelium. ACE-2-correlated gene
               signatures were used to interrogate publicly available databases
               to identify upstream signaling events and novel therapeutic
               targets. RESULTS: Stratifying by type 2 inflammatory biomarkers,
               we identified subjects who demonstrated low peripheral blood
               eosinophils accompanied by increased expression of the severe
               acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 receptor ACE2 in
               bronchial epithelium. Genes highly correlated with ACE2
               overlapped with type 1 and 2 IFN signatures, normally induced by
               viral infections. T-cell recruitment and activation within
               bronchoalveolar lavage cells of ACE2-high subjects was
               reciprocally increased. These patients demonstrated
               characteristics corresponding to risk factors for severe
               coronavirus disease 2019, including male sex, history of
               hypertension, low peripheral blood, and elevated bronchoalveolar
               lavage lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: ACE2 expression is linked to
               upregulation of viral response genes in a subset of type 2-low
               patients with asthma with characteristics resembling known risk
               factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019. Therapies targeting
               the IFN family and T-cell-activating factors may therefore be of
               benefit in a subset of patients.",

We have developed GEOmetadb in an attempt to make querying the GEO metadata both easier and more powerful. All GEO metadata records as well as the relationships between them are parsed and stored in a local MySQL database. A powerful, flexible web search interface with several convenient utilities provides query capabilities not available via NCBI tools. In addition, a Bioconductor package, GEOmetadb that utilizes a SQLite export of the entire GEOmetadb database is also available, rendering the entire GEO database accessible with full power of SQL-based queries from within R.},
